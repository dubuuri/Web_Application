+ **Project Overview**

> I created a Real-time Air Quality Dashboard to help users easily check air quality data and weather. The dashboard displays real-time information like temperature, humidity, and pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NOx, NH3, etc.). I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a clean and easy-to-use interface. Additionally, I added charts using Chart.js to make the data more visual and understandable.

> My main goal was to create a clear and intuitive UI that allows users to view multiple data points at a glance. While making changes or adding features, the code became more complex, leading to frequent errors. To address this, I prioritized ensuring the overall dashboard worked smoothly.
